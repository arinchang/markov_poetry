The treetops buck and heave
in the night wind.
Like drunks at sea leaning
too far over a rocking bulwark.
Like a woman throwing her green and gold hair
in time to a song only she can hear.

And from inside
that windswept bulk growing darker
comes a frenzied uproar
of what must be
hundreds of hidden birds.

All that noise
of wind, leaves, and branches,
all that uttering from unseen throats,
and is there no word?

All that shrieking, iterating, crying
in the rustling leaves. All that screaming,
shrilling, running din
of squeaky wheels, radiant numbers of tongues,
beaks, hubs, wings, spokes
keening in centrifugal spinning,
and not one word?
Not any? Nor part? No bearing?

One hunger, a fanned fire, roars
in the voice of the sea.

One light eats itself, unconsumed.

The wind is taking the night apart, she says.
The wind is dismantling
the leaves, the branches, the minutes, our listening,

and finding more and more
moving pieces to index:
our hands, our mouths, our voices, recurring stairs

of an imperfect past,
a rumored present,
figures multiplying inside a mirror.

Each, alone
in his dream of the world, I say,
is host and guest, a book
and the one who reads it
by the light of a vanished childhood.

Don’t say that, she says.
We see by the light of who we are.
Look at us: you inside me
inside you. We’ve lived inside
each other from the beginning.
And from before beginning.
Before the world was ever found.

Before the world was found, I say,
I dwelled inside you,
and you breathed all through me,
in my body and its happiness,
in my body and its loneliness.

After I found the world, I had to go
looking for you. Ever since the world,
I only lose you and find you.
Lose you. And find you.

The body of the beloved
is the lover’s true homeland, she says.

I can hear you, but I can’t hear me, I say,
your voice a burning gown of song and time,
and me with my ghosts, me with my mockingbird.

Don’t say that, she says.

What is my mind, I wonder,
but the reflected light of your

voice, O, burning one, O, seeing voice, O,
speaking eye that renders us

now legible,
now indecipherable, now
strangers traveling
under assumed names.

Don’t say that, she says.
Look. A single page of the wind
copied by hand
is the volume of despair
the smallest living wing displaces.
And your voice will be your cup
each day my wings shelter
your dear, momentary earth.

My mind is several minds, I say,
each abiding differently: in your eyes,
in the smell of your hair, in your voice
moving over me, in my voice moving over you.

She says, Don’t look at your hands.
Watch the shadows they make.

I say, Moving over you, my voice crosses
out of forbidden chambers of the Emperor of China,
through chronicles of exile and death in a foreign country,
to touch the ground I touch in me
when I speak to you.

She says, A new mind makes the world new.
True words are a little blue.
And being human makes the saddest music in the world.

She says, Postpone all morning bells.
The ore lies awake inside the rock, a dream
of origin waiting to be rescued.

I say, The glare of your nakedness
confounds me, a distraction
from the darker incandescence of your being.
Inside you is the safest place to be.

The radio in the kitchen is stuck
in the year I was born.
The capitals of the world are burning.

And of all the things on my mind this evening,
words weigh the least,
Death weighs the most,
and your voice’s body
beneath my voice’s moving hand
is a green agent of freedom and law,
best friend to my earth and my ache.

Of all the things keeping me from sleep,
words weigh too much, yet not enough.
Time weighs nothing at all,
but I can’t bear it.
And your body, burdened by minutes
and ancient rites, is my favorite sad song.

One wave that gives rise to three, shoulder, hip, and knee,
your body is the Lord’s pure geometry.
Disguised as Time, your body is tears, lilies,
and the mouth of the falls.

And of all the things we’re dying from tonight,
being alive is the strangest,
surviving our histories is the saddest.
Time leaves the smallest wounds,
and your body, a mortal occasion
of timeless law,
is all the word I know.
