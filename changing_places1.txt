What’s The Word! she cries
from her purchase on the iron
finial of the front gate to my heart.

The radio in the kitchen
is stuck in the year I was born.
The capitals of the world are burning.

And this sparrow with a woman’s face
roars in the burdened air — air crowded with voices,
but no word, mobbed with talking, but no word,
teeming with speech, but no word — 
this woman with the body of a bird
is shrieking fierce
buzzed volts
in the swarming babble, What’s The Word!

This evening
is the year of my birth.
The country has just gained its independence.
Social unrest grows rampant as the economy declines.
Under a corrupt government of the army and the rich come
years of mass poverty, decades of starving children
and racially-fueled mayhem. Word is

armed squads raping women by the hundreds. Word is
beheadings, public lynchings, and riots. Word is
burning, looting, curfews, and shoot-to-kill orders.
And word is more deadly days lie ahead.

Today, tomorrow, and yesterday, the forecast calls
for more misery, more poverty, more starvation,
more families fleeing their homes,
more refugees streaming toward every border.

More horror is to come, that’s the word.
More scapegoating is to come, that’s the word.
More violence is to come
on the roads,
in the streets,
in the homes, violence

in the churches, in the temples
where they preach who to love and who to hate.
How to get to heaven, and who to leave behind.
How to don the fleece of the blameless
and prosecute your neighbor.

All against all
is to come.
That’s the word.

Who hasn’t heard that! she spits.
You call yourself a poet? You
tame high finisher of paltry blots!

You publish doubt and call it knowledge!
You destroy the wisdom of ages
to gratify your envy!
You murder benevolence and virtue
with condescension. You pretend to poetry
and destroy imagination!
Your words mystify, mislead, and misdirect!
You ape The Word made flesh
with words made words
to multiply more words and words about your words!
And you ritualize these sterile pleasures,
miming joy, delight, and generation!
You celebrate cheap distractions!
Your theories bloom in suicide of the mind,
starvation of the heart, and mass maladies of the soul.
You mock and mimic sincerity!
You read and divine by irony!
You snare the little ones!
You pose stumbling blocks to the lame!
You dig pits for the blind!
You sell desolation!
Your science is despair!
What’s The Word!

I can tell she’s up to no good,
this feathered interval,
monument to the nano,
this deciding gram,
my Geronimo.

She’s out to overturn an empire,
to usurp principalities and powers,
just by swooping into the right assembly,
perplexing a senate, baffling a parliament,
or bewildering somebody’s crosshairs.

Not worth a farthing,
and without a cent,
she would own the realm
her shrill cries measure, trading
dying for being.

I tell her, I sang
in a church choir during one war
North American TV made famous.
I fled a burning archipelago in the rain,
on my mother’s back, in another war
nobody televised.

In the midst of wars worldwide, many
in countries whose names I can’t pronounce,
I tucked Christ’s promise and Adam’s disgrace
together with my pajamas under my pillow
each morning, unable to distinguish which
was God’s first thought, and which God’s second.

Therefore, I seek asylum
in the final word,
an exile from the first word,
and a refugee
of an illegible past.

Who hasn’t witnessed the laws of merging and parting,
blessing and killing! she says. Who isn’t
subject to the hand
that giveth and the hand that taketh,
the change of the guard,
with and without blood,
and their own dismembered history

fed to the unvanquished flowers?
Lift every clock’s face and see
the counting angels reckoning,
the killing angels
busy at their anvils.
Say what’s The Word,
or die!

It’s obvious she’s accounted
for what the wind will take,
what the moths must eat,
the ants carry away,
the Caesars keep.

She’s a breathing remnant
restored to springtime’s living cloth.

She’s a pair of scissors
trimming lament
to allow for all I don’t know.

And I can tell by the markings on her coat
and her black eyes
she knows which dreams to parse,
which to heed, and which to bury.

And look at those prehistoric feet.
No doubt, she’s realized the secret to surviving
her own tribe’s slaughter and dispersal.

Pocket dictionary
packed with signs in another language,
blazing shard of the original emanation,
Precambrian spark deposit,
igneous jot of infinite magnitude,
fiery iota,

something about her precise little beak
convinces me she grasps degree,
and knows which i’s to dot
and which to leave large and alone.

There are words, I say,
and there is The Word.

Every word is a fluctuating flame
to a wick that dies.

But The Word, The Word
is a ruling sum and drastic mean,
the standard that travels
without moving.

Words move,
but The Word is fixed,
the true blank.

The Word is the voice of the lamp,
and words are soot blackening the glass.

The movements of words engender time and death.
But The Word lives outside of time and death.
Inside time, death rules.
Life is death’s kingdom.
We live at dying’s rate.
Words are a sop for death.
But The Word is the mother of thresholds,
regulating life and death.

The Word begets presences impossible
to confirm,
given the blinding action of time
and the sea and the earth’s
turning repose.

And who is that supposed to feed?
Whose thirst would that quench?

she screeches, her voice materializing
a greater body of innumerable birds arriving at dominion,
increasing to overwhelm every mile of my heart,
that bloody aerie branching and leafing,
her feathers become all eyes and mouths,
her voice coming now from everywhere,
booming,

When the Lover is ready,
the Beloved will appear!

Say what’s The Word or we both die!
