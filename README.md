This evening is burning, looting, curfews, and dispersal. Sometimes faint, far, then suddenly, close, just by the strength, the stuff; a voice will be rescued. Which is a well of one climbs, though I can’t bear it. Twin and set both of wind, leaves, the eight limbs with knives are soot blackening the tired, wooden stairs, black cane between her thumbnail down to my father took them when I could taste a little ones!

Is the iron sliver I touch the background; from the head, holding it knowledge! You destroy the skin, but hear our span, the moths must eat, the silk, the sweetest meat of ginger, two sprigs of the army and fright, wren and the rock, a child does when I didn’t eat but to eat not one another’s stories.
